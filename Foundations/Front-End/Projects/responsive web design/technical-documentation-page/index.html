    <p>Wondering why Ruby is so popular? Its fans call it a beautiful, artful language. And yet, they say it’s handy and practical. What gives?</p>
    <p>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

<p>He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.</p>

    <p>Building on this, he adds: <br><br><i>"Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body.</i></br></br></p>

        <header>Installing Ruby</header>
    <p>You may already have Ruby installed on your computer. You can check inside a terminal emulator by typing:

        <br><br><center><code>ruby -v</center></code></br></br>
        This should output some information on the installed Ruby version.</p>
        <p>Choose Your Installation Method. There are several ways to install Ruby:
    <ul>
        <li>On a UNIX-like operating system, using your system’s package manager is easiest. However, the packaged Ruby version may not be the newest one.</li>
        <li>Installers can be used to install a specific or multiple Ruby versions. There is also an installer for Windows.</li>
        <li>Managers help you to switch between multiple Ruby versions on your system.</li>
        <li>Finally, you can also build Ruby from source.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On Windows 10, you can also use the Windows Subsystem for Linux to install one of the supported Linux distributions and use any of the installation methods available on that system.</p>

    <br>Here are available installation methods:</br>
    <ul>
        <li><a href class="dlinks">Package Management Systems</a></li>
        <li><a href class="dlinks">Installers</a></li>

        <p>Speed up your Ruby programming learning process by joining 1000s of other would-be Ruby developers around the globe at the Online RubyLearning Class. Step through the convenient lessons related to 'Ruby' and post your Ruby-related queries, questions and the RubyLearning team shall explain and solve them for you.</p>
        <p>The Ruby eBook contains all the Core Ruby topics covered on this site. The eBook covers Ruby 2, is over 240 pages and is in pdf format. The cost of this eBook is only a nominal US$ 9.95 and is being collected to help us maintain the site and the eBook, and also provide quality content to you</p>
        <p>Create a folder named, say. rubyprograms. We shall store all our programs in this folder. Our first program will display the string <code>'Hello'</code> on the command window and the name of the program will be say <code>p001hello.rb</code>

        <p>By convention, Ruby source files have the .rb file extension. In Microsoft Windows, Ruby source files sometimes end with .rbw, as in myscript.rbw. The Ruby coding convention states that file/directory name is lower case of class/module name with .rb extension. For example, Foo class has name foo.rb</p>

        <br>Type the following in your editor:</br>

        <br>
        <code># p001hello.rb</code>
        </br>
        <code>puts 'Hello'</code>
        <br><br>and then click File/Save As... Give the name p001hello.rb and store it in your rubyprograms folder. To run your program, open a command window and type <b><code>ruby p001hello.rb</code></b> as shown below:

        <code>c:\rubyprograms> ruby p001hello.rb</code>
        <code>Hello</code> 
        <code>c:\rubyprograms</code>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>You should see the output as shown above.</p>

        <header>Ruby Essentials</header>
            <p>Ruby is a flexible and intuitive object-oriented programming language. From modest beginnings in Japan where it rapidly gained a loyal following, the popularity of Ruby has now spread throughout the programming world.</p>
            <p>This surge in popularity can, in no small part, be attributed to the introduction and wide adoption of the Ruby on Rails framework. It is difficult, however, to get the most out of Ruby on Rails without first learning something about programming in Ruby, and this is where Ruby Essentials comes in.</p>
            <p>Ruby Essentials is a free on-line book designed to provide a concise and easy to follow guide to learning Ruby. Everything from installing Ruby and the basics of the language through to topics such as arrays, file handling and object-oriented programming are covered, all combined with easy to understand code examples which serve to bridge the gap between theory and practice.</p>
            <p>Ruby Essentials is intended to be of equal use both to those experienced in other programming languages and to novices who have chosen Ruby as their "first programming language".</p>

    <header>Programming Ruby</header>
    <h3>Ruby Sparkles</h3>
        <p>Take a true object-oriented language, such as Smalltalk. Drop the unfamiliar syntax and move to more conventional, file-based source code. Now add in a good measure of the flexibility and convenience of languages such as Python and Perl. You end up with Ruby.</p>
        <p>OO aficionados will find much to like in Ruby: things such as pure object orientation (everything's an object), metaclasses, closures, iterators, and ubiquitous heterogeneous collections. Smalltalk users will feel right at home (and C++ and Java users will feel jealous).
        At the same time, Perl and Python wizards will find many of their favorite features: full regular expression support, tight integration with the underlying operating system, convenient shortcuts, and dynamic evaluation.</p>
        <p>Ruby is easy to learn. Everyday tasks are simple to code, and once you've done them, they are easy to maintain and grow. Apparently difficult things often turn out not to have been difficult after all. Ruby follows the Principle of Least Surprise---things work the way you would expect them to, with very few special cases or exceptions. And that really does make a difference when you're programming.</p>
        <p>We call Ruby a transparent language. By that we mean that Ruby doesn't obscure the solutions you write behind lots of syntax and the need to churn out reams of support code just to get simple things done. With Ruby you write programs close to the problem domain. Rather than constantly mapping your ideas and designs down to the pedestrian level of most languages, with Ruby you'll find you can express them directly and express them elegantly. This means you code faster. It also means your programs stay readable and maintainable.</p>
        <p>Using Ruby, we are constantly amazed at how much code we can write in one sitting, code that works the first time. There are very few syntax errors, no type violations, and far fewer bugs than usual. This makes sense: there's less to get wrong. No bothersome semicolons to type mechanically at the end of each line. No troublesome type declarations to keep in sync (especially in separate files). No unnecessary words just to keep the compiler happy. No error-prone framework code.</p>
        <p>So why learn Ruby? Because we think it will help you program better. It will help you to focus on the problem at hand, with fewer distractions. It will make your life easier.</p>
